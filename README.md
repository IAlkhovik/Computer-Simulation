# Computer-Simulation

This is a repository for projects involving computer simulation. There are currently three projects, coded in Python, within this repository. 

The first project (Population and Disease IVP) contains an initial value problem in which the spread of a disease is simulated throughout a population. This project uses Scipy's solve_ivp. 

The second project (Traffic Simulation) contains a simulation of traffic spread as a traffic jam (system shock occurs). This project implements a version of an upwind scheme and the Lax_Freidrichs formula for updating traffic density and a cellular automata simulation to show movement of individual cars.

The third project (Bike Sharing Stations) is a simulation of bike sharing stations. Each station contains a certain amount of bikes, and a rider can join the system, go to a station with some probability, and ride a bike to another station with a probability.
