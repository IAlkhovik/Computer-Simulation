## Code Organization
The code is written in Python (proj1.py) and utilizes Scipy's integrate.solve_ivp. It is divided into sections with each section having it own task. The current code deals with Question 1.4, and there are commented out lines that would be used for Question 1.2.

Section 1: Imports ~ Contains necessary imports.

Section 2: Constants ~ Contains the constant values used

Section 3: Derivative Vector Definition (f) ~ Contains derivative definitions for all types of people (susceptible, infectious, recovered, and vaccinated).

Section 4: Event Definition (infectLimit) ~ Contains definition for the stopping condition.

Section 5: Solve_ivp ~ Scipy's solve_ivp

Section 6: Prints ~ Prints when the time when the stopping condition occurs.

Section 7: Plt ~ Sets up the graph visually and cuts off any time after the stopping condition.
