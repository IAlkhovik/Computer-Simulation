# Computer-Simulation

This is a repository for projects involving computer simulation. There are currently two projects within this repository. The first project contains an initial value problem in which the spread of a disease is simulated throughout a population. This project uses Scipy's solve_ivp. The second project contains a simulation of traffic spread as a traffic jam (system shock occurs). This project implements a version of an upwind scheme and the Lax_Freidrichs formula for updating traffic density and a cellular automata simulation to show movement of individual cars.
